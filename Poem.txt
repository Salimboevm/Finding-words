Oh, dear boss, it's time for you to go,
We wish it weren't true but it really is so
We hope good fortune follows you wherever you go,
We hope you have a good life and never feel low.
You've worked us real hard,
Made us work yard for yard
But now that you're leaving
And we know that you won't be staying
We hate to see you go,
But we know it really is so
Good luck!
We hate to see you go,
But we know it really is so
Even though you're leaving us,
We can't help but make a fuss
Have a nice life,
And remember all those back in your old environment
